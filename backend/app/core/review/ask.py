"""The engineer's question on one drawing: the answer_v1.1 line from the answering use case, with
the takeoff row it was looked up in (the surveyor's edits applied), or a refusal a person can read
with questions this drawing can answer.

Suggestions are built from the takeoff's rows that have a value, and a phrasing is offered only
when the parser maps it back to that row's key, so asking a suggestion is never refused.
